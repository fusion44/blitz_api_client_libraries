# Invoice

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**valueMsat** | **kotlin.Int** | The value of this invoice in milli satoshis. | 
**addIndex** | **kotlin.String** |  The index of this invoice. Each newly created invoice will increment this index making it monotonically increasing. CLN and LND handle ids differently. LND will generate an auto incremented integer id, while CLN will use a user supplied string id. To unify both, we auto generate an id for CLN and use the add_index for LND.  For &#x60;LND&#x60; this will be an &#x60;integer&#x60; in string form. This is auto generated by LND.  For &#x60;CLN&#x60; this will be a &#x60;string&#x60;. If the invoice was generated by BlitzAPI, this will be a [Firebase-like PushID](https://firebase.blog/posts/2015/02/the-2120-ways-to-ensure-unique_68). If generated by some other method, it&#39;ll be the string supplied by the user at the time of creation of the invoice.  |

**descriptionHash** | **kotlin.String** |      Hash(SHA-256) of a description of the payment. Used if the description of payment(memo) is too     long to naturally fit within the description field of an encoded payment request.      |  [optional]

**amtPaidSat** | **kotlin.Int** |      The amount that was accepted for this invoice, in satoshis. This     will ONLY be set if this invoice has been settled. We provide     this field as if the invoice was created with a zero value,     then we need to record what amount was ultimately accepted.     Additionally, it&#39;s possible that the sender paid MORE that     was specified in the original invoice. So we&#39;ll record that here as well.      |  [optional]
